# Azure DevOps Provider: Authenticating using the Personal Access Token

Azure DevOps provider supports personal access tokens for authenticating to Azure DevOps.

~> **Note**
**Personal Access Token**:   
A personal access token contains your security credentials for Azure DevOps. A personal access token identifies you, your accessible organizations, and scopes of access. You should treat them as your password.      
**A job access token (System.AccessToken**):   
A job access token (System.AccessToken) is a security token that is dynamically generated by Azure Pipelines for each job at run time. The agent on which the job is running uses the job access token in order to access these resources in Azure DevOps. It cannot identify you. You can control which resources a pipeline can access by controlling the permissions granted to a job's access token.      
Please visit [Use personal access tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows) and [Job authorization scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/access-tokens?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#job-authorization-scope) for more details.


## Create a personal access token

1. Go to your Azure DevOps. Select an organization.
2. Click the icon next to your icon at the right top corner.
3. Select "Personal access tokens".
4. Click "New Token" then create a new personal access token with the access required by your template. This will be driven primarily based on which resources you need to provision in Azure DevOps. A token with Full access scope will work but may provide more access than you need.

5. Copy the personal access token.

## Configure Environment Variables

Set the two environment variables. For more details, see the [Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-azuredevops#terraform-provider-for-azure-devops-devops-resource-manager).
`AZDO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL`. If you use bash, you can try this.

```sh
export AZDO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<Personal Access Token>
export AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL=https://dev.azure.com/<Your Org Name>
```

## Configuration

Configuration file requires `azuredevops` provider section. Then use any resources and data sources you want.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">=1"
    }
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Test Project"
  description = "Test Project Description"
}
```

## Custom Defined PAT Scopes

Personal access tokens can be used to authorize full or scoped access associated with the token for deployment of different Azure DevOps resources. If you wish to limit the PAT scope select a custom defined authorization for the token and select the permission required for management of the respective resource.
