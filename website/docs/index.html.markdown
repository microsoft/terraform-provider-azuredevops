# Azure DevOps provider

The Azure DevOps provider can be used to configure Azure DevOps project in [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) using [Azure DevOps Service REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-7.0)

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

Interested in the provider's latest features, or want to make sure you're up to date? Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/terraform-provider-azuredevops/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for version information and release notes.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Project Name"
  description = "Project Description"
}
```

## Authentication

Authentication may be accomplished using an [Azure AD service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/service-principal-managed-identity) if your organization is connected to Entra ID, or by a [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).

The provider will use the first available authentication method that is available. They are discovered in the following order:

* Personal Access Token
* With `use_oidc = true`
  * OIDC Token
  * OIDC Token File Path
  * OIDC Token Request URL
  * TFC Cloud Workload Identity Token
* Client Certificate Path
* Client Certificate
* Client Secret Path
* Client Secret
* With `use_msi = true`
  * Managed Service Identity

The OIDC service principal authentication methods allow for secure passwordless authentication from [Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials) & [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).

* [Authenticating to a Service Principal with a Managed Identity](guides/authenticating_managed_identity.html.md)
* [Authenticating to a Service Principal with a Client Certificate](guides/authenticating_service_principal_using_a_client_certificate.html.md)
* [Authenticating to a Service Principal with a Client Secret](guides/authenticating_service_principal_using_a_client_secret.html.md)
* [Authenticating to a Service Principal with an OIDC Token](guides/authenticating_service_principal_using_an_oidc_token.html.md)
* [Authenticating using a Personal Access Token](guides/authenticating_using_the_personal_access_token.html.md)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported in the `provider` block:

- `org_service_url` - (Required) This is the Azure DevOps organization url. It can also be
  sourced from the `AZDO_ORG_SERVICE_URL` environment variable.

- `personal_access_token` - This is the Azure DevOps organization personal access
  token. The account corresponding to the token will need "owner" privileges for this
  organization. It can also be sourced from the `AZDO_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `client_id` - The client id used when authenticating to a service principal or the principal id when
authenticating with a user specified managed service identity. It can also be sourced from
the `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.

- `tenant_id` - The tenant id used when authenticating to a service principal.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variable.

- `client_id_plan` - The client id used when authenticating to a service principal using the Terraform
Cloud workload identity token during a plan operation in Terraform Cloud. `client_id` may be used if
the id is the same for plan & apply.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID_PLAN` environment variable.

- `client_id_apply` - The client id used when authenticating to a service principal using the Terraform
Cloud workload identity token during an apply operation in Terraform Cloud. `client_id` may be used if

It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_ID_APPLY` environment variable.

- `tenant_id_plan` - The tenant id used when authenticating to a service principal using the Terraform
Cloud workload identity token during a plan operation in Terraform Cloud. `tenant_id` may be used if
the id is the same for plan & apply.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_TENANT_ID_PLAN` environment variable.

- `tenant_id_apply` - The tenant id used when authenticating to a service principal using the Terraform
Cloud workload identity token during an apply operation in Terraform Cloud. `tenant_id` may be used if
the id is the same for plan & apply.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_TENANT_ID_APPLY` environment variable.

- `client_secret` - The client secret used to authenticate to a service principal.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

- `client_secret_path` - The path to a file containing a client secret to authenticate to a service principal.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH` environment variable.

- `oidc_audience` - Specifies the oidc audience to request when using an `oidc_request_url`, most commonly with GitHub Actions.
It can also be sourced from the `ARM_OIDC_AUDIENCE` environment variable.
