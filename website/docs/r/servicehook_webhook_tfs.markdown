# azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs

Manages a Webhook TFS Service Hook that sends HTTP POST requests to a specified URL when Azure DevOps events occur.

## Example Usage

### Git Push Event

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name = "example-project"
}

resource "azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs" "example" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  url        = "https://example.com/webhook"
  
  git_push {
    branch        = "refs/heads/main"
    repository_id = azuredevops_git_repository.example.id
  }
}
```

### Build Completed Event with Authentication

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs" "example" {
  project_id           = azuredevops_project.example.id
  url                  = "https://example.com/webhook"
  basic_auth_username  = "webhook_user"
  basic_auth_password  = var.webhook_password
  accept_untrusted_certs = false
  
  build_completed {
    definition_name = "CI Build"
    build_status    = "Succeeded"
  }
}
```

### Pull Request Created Event with HTTP Headers

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs" "example" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  url        = "https://example.com/webhook"
  
  http_headers = {
    "X-Custom-Header" = "my-value"
    "Authorization"   = "Bearer ${var.api_token}"
  }
  
  git_pull_request_created {
    repository_id = azuredevops_git_repository.example.id
    branch        = "refs/heads/develop"
  }
}
```

### Work Item Updated Event

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs" "example" {
  project_id                = azuredevops_project.example.id
  url                       = "https://example.com/webhook"
  resource_details_to_send  = "all"
  messages_to_send          = "text"
  detailed_messages_to_send = "markdown"
  
  work_item_updated {
    work_item_type = "Bug"
    area_path      = "MyProject\\Area"
    changed_fields = "System.State"
  }
}
```

An empty configuration block will trigger on all events of that type:

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_servicehook_webhook_tfs" "example" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.example.id
  url        = "https://example.com/webhook"
  
  git_push {}
}
```
